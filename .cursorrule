Frontend Workflow for TrustSOL
User Input:

Provide an input field where users can enter their wallet address.
Add a "Fetch Credit Score" button to trigger data retrieval.
Fetch Data from Solana Backend:

Use a REST API or GraphQL endpoint provided by the Solana backend.
Send the wallet address as a query parameter.
Handle the API response, which includes credit score details, risk category, and recommendations.
Render Data Dynamically:

Display the fetched data in an organized UI:
Credit Score: Highlight prominently.
Risk Category: Use color coding (e.g., green for "Low Risk," red for "High Risk").
Recommendations: Show as a list of actionable items.
Wallet Activity Summary: Display statistics like transaction count and average balance.
Interactive UI Elements:

Implement cursor behaviors:
Pointer for clickable elements (e.g., buttons).
Help cursor for hoverable tooltips explaining credit score details or risk categories.
Add tooltips for clarity on complex terms or metrics.
Error Handling:

Notify users if the wallet address is invalid or the API call fails.
Display a user-friendly error message with retry options.
Pagination or Load More (if applicable):

If the backend supports paginated responses (e.g., for transaction history), implement a "Load More" button that fetches the next set of data using a cursor-based approach.
Styling and Responsiveness:

Use a clean and user-friendly design framework (e.g., Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap).
Ensure the UI is responsive for both desktop and mobile views.
Testing and Deployment:

Test the frontend thoroughly with various wallet addresses to ensure functionality.
Deploy the frontend to a hosting service (e.g., Vercel, Netlify) and connect it to the backend.
